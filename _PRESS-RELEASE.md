### Schoolio ###
Schoolio is a tool for catering to different learning levels in a traditionally stagnant educational environment.

## Summary ##
Schoolio is human-centered design approach to facilitating a custom learning environment in a traditionally content stagnant classroom.  Teachers can architect tailored project-based curriculum with our multi-faceted wysiwyg editor with text, photo, and video.  After assigning a project to a class, teachers provide feedback through our real-time help request system while students complete work.  While using Schoolio, students automatically broadcast their progress, enabling the teacher to gain a holistic view of current class progress.

## Problem ##
There exists a plethora of EdTech products that fail to solve universal issues in today's classrooms.  In addition to the fact that students, especially in elementary school, come from a wide variety of backgrounds with resulting skill levels, the attention said students receive varies tremendously based on a number of factors.

## Solution ##
Teachers can manage entire classes, individual students, and projects from a single platform while offering individual help to students from help request based push notifications.
